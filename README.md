# js-3d-renderer
Javascript rewrite of a non-shader 3d renderer by @hollance (orig repo: Swift-3D-Demo)
(Original written in Swift).

Here's hoping this repo is educational as porting it was for me.

I used a lot of FP paradigms (pure functions, immutability, higher order fns.)
in hopes ofmaking the software and 3d pipeline easier to reason about.

#### TODO
  - Public API
  - A bit of cleanup.

#### The future
Improving upon the original code:
  - Tests
  - World grid
  - Camera movement
  - Model / Light movement
  - Texture mapping
  - Bump mapping
  - Lighting improvements
